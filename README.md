Instacart has published a <a href="https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017">dataset</a> containing 3 million Instacart orders.  For this challenge, we want you to calculate, for each department, the number of times a product was requested, number of times a product was requested for the first time and a ratio of those two numbers.
